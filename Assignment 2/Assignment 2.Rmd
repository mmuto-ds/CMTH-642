QUESTIONS
1. Check the datatypes of the attributes. (3 points)

```{r}
wineQ<-read.csv("C:/Users/Marco/Documents/CMTH 642/Assignment 2/winequality-white.csv",header= T,sep = ";")

head(wineQ)
```


2. Are there any missing values in the dataset? (4 points)
```{r}
which(is.na(wineQ))
```

3. What is the correlation between the attributes other than Quality? (10 points)
```{r}
cor(wineQ[-12])
```

4. Graph the frequency distribution of wine quality by using Quality. (10 points)
```{r}
hist(wineQ$quality)
```

5. Reduce the levels of rating for quality to two levels as Pass and Fail. Assign the levels of 3, 4 and 5 to level Fail; and 6, 7, 8 and 9 to level Pass. (10 points)
```{r}
wineQ$quality<-ifelse(wineQ$quality <=5,"Fail","Pass")
wineQ$quality = ordered(wineQ$quality, c('Fail', 'Pass'))
tail(wineQ$quality)

```
```{r}
wineQ$quality<-ifelse(wineQ$quality <=5,0,1)

tail(wineQ$quality)
```

6. Normalize the data set. (12 points)
```{r}
normalize <- function(x) {
  return ((x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x)))
}
wineN <- as.data.frame(sapply(wineQ[-12], normalize))


```


7. Divide the dataset to training and test sets. (12 points)
```{r}
train_index = sample(1:nrow(wineN),0.7*nrow(wineN))
train.set= wineN[train_index,]
test.set= wineN[-train_index,]

train_labels = wineQ[train_index, 12] 
test_labels = wineQ[-train_index, 12]
```


```{r}
train_index = sample(1:nrow(wineN),0.7*nrow(wineN))
train.set= wineN[train_index,]
test.set= wineN[-train_index,]
```



8. Use the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict the quality of wine using its attributes. (12 points)
```{r}
LR=glm(formula = train_labels~.,
       data = train.set,
       family = binomial)
pred=predict(LR,type ='response',newdata = test.set)

library(InformationValue)
optCutOff <- optimalCutoff(test.set$quality, pred)[1]
y_pred = ifelse(pred > optCutOff, 1, 0)

```


9. Display the confusion matrix to evaluate the model performance. (12 points)
```{r}
CM_LR = table(test_labels, y_pred)
CM_LR

```

10. Evaluate the model performance by computing Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity. (15 points)
```{r}
table(wineQ$quality)
```



```{r}
library(InformationValue)
optCutOff <- optimalCutoff(test_labels, pred)[1]
y_pred = ifelse(pred > optCutOff, 1, 0)
```
```{r}
head(wineN[-train_index,])
```




This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
install.packages("InformationValue")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
